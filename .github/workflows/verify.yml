# Verify workflow - runs linting and tests
# Triggered on PRs and reusable by other workflows
#
# This workflow is designed to be:
# 1. Required in branch protection (blocks PRs if failing)
# 2. Called by release.yml before deploying
#
# Test strategy:
# - Unit/integration tests and E2E tests run against ephemeral Neon branches
# - Branch is created by test global setup, cleaned up by Playwright teardown
# - Same flow works locally and in CI (no special CI handling needed)
